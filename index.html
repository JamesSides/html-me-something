			<p>I recently decided to build my own PC after years of over spending on prebuilt machines filled with low to mid quality components.

The process was far easier than I anticipated thanks to PcPartsPicker.com. 

This site essentially allowed me to build my entire computer virtually before I ever ordered my first part.

This removed much of the fear and anxiety associated with the risk of choosing parts that were not compatible with each other.</p>

			<p> After receiving all of my parts the build itself was pretty straight forward, taking approximately 6 hours from start to finish.

Most of that time was spent researching the proper build techniques and triple checking I was not making any mistakes.

If I had to do it again I could do it in under an hour without breaking a sweat.</p>
			
			<p>My one regret with the build is that I did not order the parts I really wanted the first time around.  I settled for a GTX 1060 graphics card in an attempt to save money but ultimately ended up ordering a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127943&cm_re=MSI_GTX_1080-_-14-127-943-_-Product">GTX 1080</a> card (seen below).  <br></p>

			<p>As a result I now have a GTX 1060 sitting on my desk with no use for it.  (I'll be listing it for sale on eBay so try to recoup some of the cash I paid for it) </p>
			
			<p>Still, overall I am happy with the finished product including the multiple monitor set up I went with.  Here's a pic of what my crazy desk looks like now...(recently shared this on Facebook&reg;)</p><br>
